The void.

this is, like, a description of the scene when you first get here. this is a thing you [click]{'scene':1} << that sends you to a new scene, and if we want a picture in the text like ![platypus] the name of the pic would be 'foot_pic.jpg', the .jpg is implied.... [this]{'scene':2,'hover':'platypus'} has an image show up when you hover over it, where footy is the name of the image.

SCENE 1000

This guide was originally meant to be a guide to navigating the ocean; how to use a paddle, maybe how to devise a clever trap to catch seabirds while on your palm raft with wilson, [how to read clouds,]{‘scene’:1010} how to maintain [soft skin]{‘scene’:1020} while caked in salt.
But do you even know where the ocean is? [I assume if you’re here that you have no idea.]{‘scene’:1100}

SCENE 1100

Are you lost in the ocean? Then you have more pressing concerns at hand. In light of ‘The Men Parted the Sea to Devour the Water’ I think this manual could not have come at a more relevant time.
