~HOW TO FIND THE OCEAN~
Commissioned by the former Oceanographer’s Guild 1998

[Researcher’s Note]{‘scene’:1000} - How to and How not to engage with this Literature
[Preface]{‘scene’:2000} - The ethnographic dialogue of water
[Part 1. Sand]{‘scene’:3000} - In which we identify a lack of Ocean
[Part 2. Horticulture and NaCL]{‘scene’:4000} - In which I take a close look at the relationship between roots and salt and how to not be salty
[Part 3. The Dangers of Sunscreen]{‘scene’:5000} - This section was necessary to fulfill grant requirements
[Part 4. Motivations]{‘scene’:6000} - Why do you want to find blue forevers in the first place?

This guide was originally meant to be a navigational one for the Ocean; how to use a paddle, maybe how to devise a clever trap to catch seabirds while on your palm raft with wilson, [how to read clouds,]{‘scene’:1010} how to maintain [soft skin]{‘scene’:1020} while caked in salt.
But do you even know where the Ocean is? Or what it is? [I assume if you’re here that you have no idea.]{‘scene’:1100}

Clouds are majestic creatures. Stare long enough into a textureless grey sky and the Ganzfeld effect will bring you to me.

Are you lost in the ocean? Then you have more pressing concerns at hand. In light of ‘The Men Parted the Sea to Devour the Water’ I think this manual could not have come at a more relevant time.

~MOTIVATIONS~
We must assume that you, having picked up a copy of this Guide (perhaps from a local ex-beach dweller, Aquatic Simulation Centre, or puddle-that-once-knew), are indeed a person with an interest in locating large Ocean-like bodies of water. 
Not to be second guessing you or anything, but to ensure that you are able to properly identify a body of water of this scale and importance, we have included a short questionnaire within this Guide to help you discern with finality that it is indeed the Ocean you are actually searching for! No harm done if what you are looking for is truly a quail’s nest, or maybe some paper towels? (Although, again, not to be second guessing you - but you are heading in the exact opposite direction of the ocean if your goal is a paper towel, and the help you need will not be within the scope of this guide)...

Use a pen and paper to tally your score (pencils will not be accepted). Please answer the following questions as honestly as possible.

~AMATEUR OCEANOGRAPHERS OCEAN IDENTIFYING APTITUDE TEST~

Erm, this is a bit awkward, but I believe that you may have ended up here by accident. By all accounts, it seems that what you are actually searching for is likely to be found in Aisle 7 of that grocer on the corner you once visited about 3 years ago. Please carefully place this Guide on the floor and resume with your daily schedule.

SCENE 7000
/
You have vague recollections of what it felt like to brush your fingers across the surface of the sea that very first day. 
You stayed by the shoreline every night back then, named the stones on the beach, rubbed the salt into your gums. The sounds of the tide formed words behind your closed eyes - the pages came to your palms in waves. 
Then, one morning, you were no longer sea-side. The water had disappeared. You still had those waterlogged pages clenched in your fist, ink dripping down to where the sea should, by all intents and purposes, still be swelling. 
It was the loss of a lover, a confidante, a mother. The deafening silence, the Ocean’s lack.
You are indescribably pulled TOWARDS.


[To the woods near town:]{‘scene’:7001} trees must draw their water from *somewhere*.
[To the remnants of those pages.]{‘scene’:7002} Link to an image? 
[To bed.]{‘scene’:7003} You slept fitfully. Perhaps the Ocean made a commotion during its disappearance.
END

SCENE 7001
/
There was a fire in the woods that very night. Or at least we think so. You’ve heard reports of a dull, ochre glow pulsing at the horizon for many hours, its light strengthening to a blinding glare upon closer investigation. The glow seemed unnervingly natural for something so peculiar, as though it had shone at night unnoticed for many years before this particular outburst.
The next morning the entire forest had disappeared, and the glow with it. How awfully inconvenient that this disappearing act mirrors that of the Ocean just hours before.

You spend several hours pondering the gaping maw that must have swallowed the trees (and their water?)
Actually, you don’t recall there ever being a forest at all…
Someone has tied your shoelaces together without you noticing. You faceplant at what was (presumably) once the forest’s edge as you attempt to investigate.

SCENE 7003

You haven’t the energy to return to your apartment back in town - in fact, you’ve lost all sense of time after having spent so many nights and days at the Ocean’s side, and aren’t even sure that apartment IS your apartment anymore. You lay back down on the ground but sleep doesn’t come.
Your thoughts turn to:

	A) Your mother. 
	B) The fact that you’ve actually got a lot of sand in your mouth right now and you’re not sure how it got there.
C) Where the fuck did the Ocean go?
